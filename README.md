# 11/22 - UPDATE ~ This script has been removed. Apologies, received a PR from the developer of HWiNFO and will no longer be hosting this solution out of respect even if I disagree with the current monetization strategy, it is the developers right to name their price etc. And the purpose was not to evade the license it was to make only basic usage of the utility for overlays such as rainmeeter etc. I wanted to let anyone who was directed here know that is why you have reached a dead end. And I don't want you to think of this as the end. I am very busy now but if the developer of HWiNFO does not reply to my response to the PR with anything that gives us hope for a solution for basic use for users who can't yet afford the license I will try to find an alternative solution that does not use HWiNFO as the purpose here was to provide basic PC functionality I think should be possible for all experienced user regardless of income class. We will find something for yall as soon as I can regardless. I hope you can understand and vibe with this outcome. Peace!

# HWiNFO_Refresh
> A very simple script with the purpose of terminating and relaunching HWiNFO before the 12 hour timer is exhausted for free users. This is done so HWiNFO can be used for tools like Rainmeeter without having to manually relaunch to retain Shared Memory Support in versions past 6.42.

# Installation:
1. Unpack the .exe or the .ahk source file. Note: If you wish to use the ".ahk" file (plain-text source code), you must install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com).
2. Set up a task in task scheduler to run the script at boot.

### Notes / Hints:
> This software is intended to make it a smoother experience while you are testing HWiNFO as a solution for providing Shared Memory Support to other applications. Functionality was added to disable this feature after 12 hours, after which you must manually re-enable it. The developers of HWiNFO deserve to get paid for their work, I understand their desire to monetize the project. Developement of free software takes time and has the potential to pull developers away from work that might otherwise cover their personal expenses. Buying a license will enable you to use other features and support continued development. This script is not intended to be a substitute for a license by any means. I encourage you to purchase a license if you like the product so they can continue to support newer hardware etc. If this tool poses any risk to continued developement it will be removed without notice. If you can afford HWiNFO; I repeat, please purchase it.

> HWiNFO is expected to be located at C:\\Program Files\\HWiNFO64\\HWiNFO64.EXE, if it's not there this script will not function as intended.

### Current Issues / Workarounds:
- I don't think so.

### Planned Features:
> Nope. Feel free to raise an issue if this does not work for you or you have an idea for improvement. Otherwise I do not see the likelyhood of any updates on the horizon.

### Dependencies / Requirements:
> This software seeks to launch HWiNFO as such you *obviously* would need [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com).

> This was written 100% with [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com), I first touched [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) in 2010 or so. Why AutoHotkey? [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) is super easy and efficient to carry out simple tasks programatically. I don't feel the need to pull out a more sophisticated language, honestly. In every release (I don't think there will ever be a new release of this 🤣) there is a ".ahk" plain-text source file, that you can inspect and even make changes. If you install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com) you will be able to execute the source code directly.

 >If you do not like AutoHotkey... You are most entitled to that opinion, I encourage you to move right along and carry out this task however else you want. Otherwise as Deadpool said, MAXIMUM EFFORT!!! 🥴 AutoHotkey it is! 🤣
